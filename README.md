# NasaSpaceAppChallenge
Code developed at the Hackathon for the STAR Challenge
The code referring to the chatbot that manages the available standards describes a landing page.
The trained AI is stored on Azure servers, and the page only absorbs the resource via a link.


The template described in the folder "ExportedTemplate-star1" is focused on the connection with hardware for data collection, allowing the acquisition of new data, which are analyzed for a possible improvement of a standard, depending on the area to which it was applied.
